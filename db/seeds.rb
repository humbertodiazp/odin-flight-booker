# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   airports = Airport.create([{ airport_code: "MIA" },{ airport_code: "DAL" },{ airport_code: "PHX" }, { airport_code: "SFO" }, { airport_code: "DEN" }, { airport_code: "LAX"}, { airport_code: "NYC"} ])
